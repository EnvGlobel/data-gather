# data-gather

This repo is responsible for transforming all the raw data from different websites into structured data and saving it into a centralized database.

Raw data can be found (for now) at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1QpeLQr3bLKdNYDKZ1QnzEqSFwBL6-fWZ. This is generated by the scrapping module.

This raw data should be taken from merge between scrapping and preprocessing modules.
