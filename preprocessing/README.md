# preprocessing

This module is responsible for transforming all the raw data into structured data and saving it into a centralized database.

Raw data can be found (for now) at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1QpeLQr3bLKdNYDKZ1QnzEqSFwBL6-fWZ.

This raw data should be taken from merge with scrapping repo.
